# Hello World

This is a small repository for learning and playing around with C programming.

> Move along, nothing to see here...

## Main Program
The "main" program is a final showcase of everything I've learned. It will be updated as I progress. 

> The program itself takes inventory of an imaginary fruit stand. 
**Included fruit**:
- Apples :apple:
- Bananas :banana:
- Grapes :grapes:
- Orange :orange:

Feel free to run it in your terminal if you like.
